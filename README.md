MyToken Solidity Smart Contract
Overview
This Solidity smart contract, named MyToken, serves as a fundamental implementation of a token system. It provides functionalities for both minting and burning tokens, managing essential details like Token Name, Token Abbreviation, and Total Supply. Users can utilize the contract to mint new tokens, thereby increasing the total supply, or burn existing tokens to decrease it.

Description
The MyToken Solidity smart contract introduces public variables to store token details and utilizes a mapping structure to manage addresses and their corresponding balances. The mint function enables users to augment the total supply and the balance of a specific address. Conversely, the burn function diminishes the total supply and the balance of the specified address. Robust conditionals are incorporated into the burn function to ensure that the sender’s balance is adequate for the intended burn amount.

Getting Started
Installing
To integrate the MyToken smart contract, follow these steps:

Download the Solidity code and save it with a “.sol” extension.
Executing Program
Deploy the contract on a compatible Ethereum blockchain.
Interact with the contract using a decentralized application or a tool like Remix.
Call the mint function by providing an address and a value to increase the total supply and address balance.
Call the burn function with an address and value to decrease the total supply and address balance.
code
// Example of calling mint function
MyToken.mint(address, value);

// Example of calling burn function
MyToken.burn(address, value);
